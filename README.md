This is a work-in-progress game that Uses Phaser and Electron as it is intended to run like a desktop application.

This game has only been tested on a Linux-based OS (Pop!_OS) so I don't know how well it'll work on Windows.

To start the game, make sure you have nodejs and npm installed.

Once you have node and npm installed, clone this repository and run `npm start` in the terminal.
